# MMFF94
Partial implementation of the chemistry force field MMFF94 in C++ as a final procjet for the course "CHEM179: Numerical Algorithms applied to Computational Quantum Chemistry at UC Berkeley" (spring semester 2025). The implementation is partial and does only work on saturated hydrocarbons. Most of the work is based on the equations provided in the article "Merck Molecular Force Field. I. Basis, Form, Scope, Parameterization and Performance of MMFF94" by T. A. Halgren, J. Comp. Chem., 17, 490-519 (1996). 

MMFF parameteres were retrived from: https://ftp.wiley.com/public/journals-back/jcc/suppmat/17/490

Molecular geometries for sample inputs were retrived from: https://cccbdb.nist.gov/expgeom1x.asp
