# MMFF94
Partial implementation of the chemistry force field MMFF94 in C++ as a final procjet for the course "CHEM179: Numerical Algorithms applied to Computational Quantum Chemistry at UC Berkeley" (spring 2025). Implementation is based on the equations provided in "Merck Molecular Force Field. I. Basis, Form, Scope, Parameterization and Performance of MMFF94," T. A. Halgren, J. Comp. Chem., 17, 490-519 (1996)". 

Parameteres were retrived from: https://ftp.wiley.com/public/journals-back/jcc/suppmat/17/490
